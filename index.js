//Problem 1
//Ask the user to enter a word.
// Keep asking them to enter a word until they enter the letter 'q'.

// this is an infinite loop bc you never update the value of userInput
let userInput = prompt("Enter a word");
while(userInput !== 'q')
{
    alert("good job")
}


//Problem 2
//Make any string array all lower case strings.
//If you don't remember how to use that Google it.

let array1 = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];
